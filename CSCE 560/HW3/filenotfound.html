"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For"
</h1>
<p>
I have climbed highest mountain
I have run through the fields
Only to be with you
Only to be with you
</p>
<p>
I have run 
I have crawled
I have scaled these city walls
These city walls
Only to be with you
</p>
<p>
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
</p>
<p>
I have kissed honey lips
Felt the healing in her fingertips
It burned like fire
This burning desire
</p>
I have spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil
It was warm in the night
I was cold as a stone
</p>
<p>
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
</p>
<p>
I believe in the kingdom come
Then all the colors will bleed into one
Bleed into one
Well yes I'm still running
</p>
You broke the bonds and you
Loosed the chains
Carried the cross
Of my shame
Of my shame
You know I believed it
</p>
<p>
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for...
