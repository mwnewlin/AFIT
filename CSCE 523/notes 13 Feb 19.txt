Plan

State Space: Plan representation
	2 ways to represent a planning problem
		state space
		plan space
		
	States rep'd as a conjunction of instantiated literals (no functions)
	Goals described as a conjuction of literals (possibly with variables)
	
State Space Planner
	Operators can have variables
	Completely solves one goal then tacks on plan for next goal
		Progression Planner (forward search with A*) - prunes if high fan in
		Regression planner (backward search w/GPS) - prunes options if high fan out

	General Problem Solver (GPS)
		if goals in initial state then return true
		choose difference d in goals between initial state & goals

Plan Space Planning
	Node
		State Space: World State
		Plan Space: Partial plan
	Operators
		State Space: next plan in sequence
		plan space: 
			add link from existing action to open condition
			add a plan step to fulfill open condition
			order a step in the sequence
	Gradually move from incomplete plans to complete plans
		
Partially ordered plans
	
Clobbering
	A cloberrer is a potentially intervening step that destroys the condition
	achieved by a causal link
	
	We can prevent this by orderging the cloberrer before the start
	or after the end of the link
	

Hierarchical Planning	(ABSTRIPS) Abstract Strips
	Plan at most abstract level
		Ignore "less critical" predicates
	Uing the abstract plan, fill in details
	
	
Graphplan mutex constraints
	Mutex (Mutually exclusive), assists graphplan in maintaining state
		Inconsistent effect
		Interference
		Competing Needs

Critical Path (shortest path)
