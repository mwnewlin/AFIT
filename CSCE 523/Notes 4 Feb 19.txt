Alpha-Beta Properties
	Pruning doesn't affect final result (if heuristic is admissible)
	Good move ordering improves effectiveness of pruning
	With perfect ordering tc is O(b^m/2) w/out its more O(b^3m/4)
	
Problems with fixed ply
	horizon effect
		Inevitable losses are postponed or unachievable goals appear achievable inside the SS
		Short term gains mask traps
		
How to counter horizon effect 
	Feedover
		Don't cut off search in non-smooth board position
	    "smoothness" similar to conditioning for matrices
    Secondary Search
		search further down selected path
		
	Progressive deepening (IDS)
		Search only one ply, then 2 ply, ... until time runs out
		
		
3 Player Games
	Each player maxes own utility
	each node stores a vector of utilities
	entire vector is backed up
	
Non-deterministic Games
	Dice!
	Instead of Max, Min, etc... its Max, Dice, Max,...
	Generally uses an expecto-Max function to maximize expectation
	
Transposition Tables
	Position in table was previously searched d ply deepening, but current position
	requires a search to depth d'
		d' < d return d (more accurate)
		d = d' return d (same accuracy)
		d' > d not accurate enough to use
		
	If V <= alpha < beta then V an upper bounc on correct val
	If alpha < V < beta then V an accurate val
	If alpha < beta <= V then V a lower bound on correct val
