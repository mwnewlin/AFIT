Remember types of agents


Hill Climbing search (used a lot in ML)

Beam Search
	Like Best First except n instead of infinity
	If n=1 then Beam search is UCS
	
A* Search
	Combines cost so far & hueristic evaluation
	If hueristic is wrong, can mess up performance
		- overestimating is worse than underestimating
		
UCS worst case is O(b^m)in T & S 
Look at p.38 of slides for comparisons
		
IDA*
	IDS guided by A*
	Worst Case: Time - O(b^m), Space - O(m)
