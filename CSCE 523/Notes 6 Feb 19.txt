Knowledge Representation
	Knowledge Bases
		KB - A set of sentences in a formal language
		Declarative approach to building an agent 
			Tell it what it needs to know
		Then it can ask itself what to do
			Answers follow from KB
			
KB Agent
	KB Agent must be able to
		Represent states actions etc
		incorporate new percepts
		update internal representations of world
		deduce hidden properties about the world
		deduce appropriate actions
		
	We will
		Describe properties of languages to use for logical reasoning
		describe techniques for deducing new information from current information
		Apply search to deduce specifically needed information
		
Wumpus World Game (weird)

Logic	
	Formal language for representating info to draw conclusions
		Sentence
		Syntax
		Semantics
		Proof System

A few formal logics		
	Language 				Ontological Commitment 			Epistemological Commitment
	Propositional Logic 	facts 							true/false/unknown
	Predicate Logic 		facts, objects, relations 		true/false/unknown
	Temporal Logic 			facts, objects, relations, time true/false/unknown
	Probability Theory 		facts 							degree of belief in [0.0 .. 1.0]
	Fuzzy Logic 			degree of truth 				degree of belief in [0.0 .. 1.0]

Definitions
		Meaning of a sentence is a mapping onto the "real world"
		A sentence is valid (a tautology) iff true under all possible interpretations
		Not valid:
			A AND NOT A 
			A OR B (sat'ble)
			
Entailment
	sentences entail sentences
	facts follow from facts
	
Proof Methods
	Model Checking
	Application of inference rules
Pf by inference
	Complete inference procedure can generate all sentences in the KB
