minimax algorithms
	Maxes player 1's utility 
	player 2 min's player 1's utility
	
Alpha Beta minimax
	Prune parts of search tree with [alpha, beta] window
    Max only updates alpha but compares to beta
	Min only updates beta but compares to alpha
	
Using Iterative Deepening you can use prior info on next move

Killer move heuristic
	store path to best move as heuristic
	
History Heuristic
	Store number of moves selected out of the maxes and mins based on 
		their move location
