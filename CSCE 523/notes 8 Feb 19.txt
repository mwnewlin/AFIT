Notes 8 Feb 19

First Order Predicate Calculus
	PL only uses propositions
	FOL includes
		Objects
		Predicate/Relations
		Functions
		
FOPC Definitions
	Term - Identifies an object (fuction, constant)
	Atomic Sentence - predicate with term arguments
	Literals - atomic and negated atomic sentences
	Connectives (if, iff, and, or ,not)
	Quantifiers(There exists, for all)
	
	
Instantiation
	UI can be applied several times to add new sentences
		new KB is logically equivalent to the old
		
	EI can be applied once to replace the existential sentence
		new KB is NOT logically equivalent but is SATble iff old KB was SAT'ble

Unification
	Given expressions p and q, a UNIFIER of p and q is an binding list O
	is any binding list such that pO = qO
	Expressions w1 & w2 are unifiable iff there exists a substitution S 
		such that, w1S = w2S
		
Substitution
	Valid Types
		Variable --> constant
		variable1 --> variable2
		variable --> function (if fn doesn't contain a(that) variable)
