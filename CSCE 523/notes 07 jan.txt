CSCE 523 Notes 7 Jan 19
Search


Permeates all of AI
	choices we make to optimize a performance measure
	
EX: Holiday in Romania, currently in Arad, want to reach Bucharest
	Formulate Goal: 
	Formulate Problem:
	Find Solution:
	
	
Agent's Process to solve problem
	Formulate 
	Search
		view search space as a tree
		initial state --> root
		Actions --> edges - may have costs
		Solution is path from initial to solution node
		search strategies differ only in the queueing strategy
			Perf Issues:
				Completeness (Always finds solution)
				Cost of Search (time & space)
				Cost of solution, optimal solution
				Make use of knowledge of the domain, blind search vs informed search
		Gen search function (p. 10 of slides)
		In the book, the goal check for BFS is inserted in the for each loop
		to reduce complexity of t & s. (not useful in general)
