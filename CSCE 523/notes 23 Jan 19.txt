Genetic Algorithms
	Adapted procedure based on mechanics of natural genetics & natural selection
	2 Essential components
		1. Survival of the fittest
		2. Recombination
		
	Chromosome = string
	gene = single bit or single subsequence in string
	2 Spaces
		Phenotype Space 
		Genotype  Space
	Creation of solutions is called big bang
		If there isn't enough material for the solution in the BB, the solution may not be found
	
	RTA* 
		Pick best f(n), store 2nd best f(n) as new h(n)
		Not optimal unless given infinite time
		
	LRTA* 
		Pick and store best f(n)
		Converges to optimal
